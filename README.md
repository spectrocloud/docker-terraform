# Docker Terraform

The project is the Docker image, which includes a Terraform binary, common Terraform plugins.

This repo was original forked from [broadinstitute/docker-terraform](https://github.com/broadinstitute/docker-terraform), and then copied into this repo as a
non-forked repo due to the reason that [LFS don't allow large files to be uploaded into public forked project](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/issues/1906).

This is a sub-project of [Terraform Controller](https://github.com/oam-dev/terraform-controller)

project, but I haven't received a response.
